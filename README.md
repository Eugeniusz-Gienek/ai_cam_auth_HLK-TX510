# ai_cam_auth_HLK-TX510
The project is providing authorization to the system by using the AI HLK-TX510 KIT demo board in conjuncion with ESP32-C3 super mini.
How to install and use - please read the [WIKI](https://github.com/Eugeniusz-Gienek/ai_cam_auth_HLK-TX510/wiki)
Currently the connection is via RS232, working on the simpler (from hardware point perspective) version via WiFi - however the security in that case should be additionally guaranteed - so currently the RS232 is the way to go.
